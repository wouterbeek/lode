# LODE

This is a copy of LODE, an ontology for publishing descriptions of
historical events as Linked Data, and for mapping between other
event-related vocabularies and ontologies.

## Why are you hosting a copy of this dataset?

We are hosing this vocabulary, since we could not find it anywhere
online anymore.  At the same time, this vocabulary is used in many
Linked Datasets in [YALC](https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC), so it is
important to have a copy of this vocabulary available.
